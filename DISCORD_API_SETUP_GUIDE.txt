DISCORD API SETUP GUIDE - How to Get Discord OAuth Credentials
================================================================================

This guide will walk you through setting up a Discord Application and obtaining
the Client ID and Client Secret needed for the KEYREWARDS platform.

================================================================================
STEP 1: Create a Discord Account (If You Don't Have One)
================================================================================

1. Go to https://discord.com
2. Click "Register" or "Login" if you already have an account
3. Complete the registration process
4. Verify your email if required

================================================================================
STEP 2: Access Discord Developer Portal
================================================================================

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications
3. Login with your Discord account credentials
4. You should see the Discord Developer Portal dashboard

================================================================================
STEP 3: Create a New Application
================================================================================

1. In the Discord Developer Portal, click the "New Application" button
   (located in the top right corner)
2. A popup will appear asking for an application name
3. Enter a name for your application (e.g., "KEYREWARDS" or "My Rewards Platform")
4. Click "Create"
5. You'll be taken to the "General Information" page for your new application

================================================================================
STEP 4: Get Your Application ID (Client ID)
================================================================================

1. On the "General Information" page, you'll see several fields
2. Look for the "Application ID" section
3. You'll see a long number (e.g., 1464199776823279636)
4. Click the "Copy" button next to the Application ID
5. Save this number - this is your DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
6. ⚠️ NOTE: The "Public Key" shown below is NOT what you need

================================================================================
STEP 5: Get Your Client Secret
================================================================================

1. In the left sidebar, click on "OAuth2" (NOT "General Information")
2. You'll see the OAuth2 settings page
3. Look for the "Client Information" section at the top
4. Find the "Client Secret" field
5. If you see "Reset Secret" button:
   - Click "Reset Secret"
   - A warning will appear - click "Yes, do it!"
   - Your Client Secret will be revealed (it's a long string of characters)
6. If the Client Secret is already visible, just copy it
7. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Copy this secret immediately - you won't be able to see it again!
8. Save this secret - this is your DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET

================================================================================
STEP 6: Add Redirect URI
================================================================================

1. Still on the OAuth2 page, scroll down to the "Redirects" section
2. Click "Add Redirect"
3. Enter your redirect URI:
   
   For Local Development:
   http://localhost:8000/auth/discord/callback/
   
   For Production (replace with your actual domain):
   https://yourdomain.com/auth/discord/callback/
   
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: The redirect URI must match EXACTLY (including trailing slash)

================================================================================
STEP 7: Configure OAuth Scopes
================================================================================

1. Still on the OAuth2 page, look for the "Scopes" section
2. Check the box for "identify"
   - This allows the app to get the user's Discord username and avatar
   - This is the only scope needed for KEYREWARDS
3. Make sure "identify" is checked
4. You don't need any other scopes for this project
